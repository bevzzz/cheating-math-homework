## Recap: Vector Databases

A vector database is ...

a specialized type of database...

designed to store and retrieve data objects based on their _semantic properties_ rather than the data itself...

by building indices on top of their vectorized representation.

<br>

##### What is it used for?

Almost anything can be transformed into a vector and stored in a vector database: text, images, audio, graphs, etc.

## Calculating Euclidean distance with Weaviate

##### Problem:

> It's 8pm and you're on the couch, browsing 9GAG after a long but fulfilling day at work.
> Your kid, who's recently moved to the 9th grade, shuffles in and asks you to help with their math homework.
> As the eyes brush the page, a look of dismay comes upon your face... it's **Vector Distances**.

<br>

Q: Can a Vector Database solve your problem?

A: Of course it can.

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

___

To prove it, let's build a simple CLI tool powered by a vector database.

---

### Prerequisites

1. A vector database -- [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate)

Weaviate _(we-vee-eight)_ is an open source database written in Go.

- Supports multi-modal search (text/vector/hybrid)
- Easy to run locally with Docker üêã
- Comes with built-in embedding modules
- Has clients for Python, JS/TS, Java, and Go

2. Python environment

```sh
mkdir cheating-math-homework/ && cd cheating-math-homework/
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. ~~A kid~~

Contrary to your expectations, it will not require a kid.

### Vector Distance: recap

To calculate Euclidean distance between 2 vectors we:

<br>

- [x] Created a new collection and configured the vector index to use `l2-squared` vector distance.

```md
Other available distance metrics include `cosine`, `dot`, `hamming`, and `manhattan`.
```

<br>

- [x] Stored a new object to that collection and provided `v1` as our _custom vector_.

- [x] Used `near_vector` search to find the **closest object** to `v2` and fetched "distance" metadata as an additional parameter.

```md
Additional parameters like `id`, `certainty` and `score` provide more metadata on search results, while `rerank` can be used to reorder them.
```

<br>

Remember that we also had to take the square root of the returned distance.

## Bonus!

##### Problem:

> Our other child, still a toddler, will be taking an entrance exam to the kindergarten next week.

<br>

Q: Can a vector database get your kid into kindergarten too? 

A: ...

<br>

<br>

### "Which word does not belong?"

Commonly used to test children's ability to group objects by similarity, the game is a choice of several words, one of which is distinctly different from the others:

```
apple organge banana sponge
```
___

Let's extend our handy little tool and pit it against some examples from [Baamboozle](https://www.baamboozle.com/game/993946). 

---

### Words: recap

To find the "outlier" word we:

- [x] Enabled `text2vec-contextionary` module and ran Contextionary in a separate container

```md
Enabling more features is easy with Weaviate's "Configurator"
https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose#configurator
```

<br>

- [x] Created a new collection and configured a vectorizer for it.
- [x] Stored the words as separate objects, _letting the vectorizer do the job_.
- [x] Searched for `n-2` similar words using `near_text` search and counted their occurrences.
- [x] Found the word which was returned the least number of times.
